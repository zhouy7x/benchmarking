Benchmarking Hardware Request.

One of the goals of the benchmarking workgroup is to be able to run benchmarks on each release to be able to compare performance and look for regressions.  In order to be able to do this individual runs need to be comparable against each other.  One of the key requirements in order to satisfy this is that the underlying hardware/software provide a consistent level of resources over time.

At this time the group members believe the best way to achieve consistency is to have dedicated as opposed shared resources. As such we are asking for hardware that will be dedicated to the benchmarking workgroup and that a single OS instance be installed on that hardware so that when benchmarks are run in that OS instance we are guaranteed that the same resources are available as for previous runs.

We will start by running benchmarks on linux x86 but would like to expand to other architectures and operating systems over time. As such we.d like to build the following hardware inventory:

+ linux x86 - ubuntu (priority 1)
+ windows
+ mac
+ SunOS
+ Arm
+ ppc linux BE
