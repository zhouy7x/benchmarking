Multi node run allows distributed testing/benchmarking. You can run multiple applications on the same machine or on a pool of machines. This run requires following three(3) scripts:
 - run_multiple_instance.sh 
   - Runs multiple instances of server application, client and mongodb.
   - It supports two modes of operations, a bare metal (default run mode 0) and a container (run mode 1)

 - multiple_instance_config.json - The input configuration file for multiple instances. Each instance requires these parameters:
    ```
      {
        "server_ip":"127.0.0.1", //IP address where the server runs
        "server_port":"9001",  // Port the server listens to
        "db_name":"node-els-db1", // Database name
        "db_ip":"127.0.0.1", // Database IP address
        "db_port":"27018" // Port database listens to
      }
    ```
 - multiple_instance_post_process.py - Script to post process and summarize data from all the instances
    -  Post processes data from each instance to generate a summary data file.
    -  Generates live throughput and response time graphs (configurable through -g or -showgraph option. If set to 1 graphs are generated)

 - a results_multiple_instance will be created after the run which contains all the result directories for which are designated by the date and time stamp.
  - log directory with individual instance logs and master log designated by the date and time stamp.
  - Master RTdata file - summarizes data (min, mean, max, 95 and 99 percentile Response time and Throughput) from all the instances for an interval given in the client config file.
  - Summary Throughput and Response time graphs.
  - Master summary file - Provides the combined throughput of all the instances, 99 percentile response time, the number of instances, concurrency used, a detailed summary of response times and each instance summary.

In addition there are three more supporting scripts (for remote execution):
 - start-server.sh - Used to start server and mongodb during a bare metal run.
   - requires NODE_PATH (path to node binary) to be set before the run.
 - stop-server.sh - Used to stop server and mongodb during a bare metal run
 - container-startup.sh - Used to start containers.
   - Currently uses Nodejs v6.10.0. Check the docker file.

Steps in a typical run:
 - Create local clone of the workload
 - Prepare multiple_instance_config.json file with appropriate information.
   - Hint: Number of server instances (number of blocks in a file) you want to run.
   - Update mater.sh script to with number of server instances as well (double check)
 - Make sure NODE_PATH is set to Node.js install. e.g. NODE_PATH=/opt/local/node-v6.10.0-linux-x64
 - Execute run_multiple_instance.sh script
 - The multiple_instance_config.json file is processed to create server and client config files for each instance.
 - The server code is copied to a remote server (IP provided in the config file) and each server instance is started.
 - A curl command is issued to check if every server instance is up and running.
 - Each client instance is started once all the servers are up. This also makes a server request to populate database.
 - Each client waits till all the instances have finished loading database.
 - The post processing script starts in the background once all the clients have their first summary data available.
 - The server application(s) and mongodb stops once post processing is completed.

Setup instructions:
Auto-login setup between the client and the server
  - SSH auto login needs to be set up between the client and the server.RSH and RCP uses this auto login to remote into the server and start the server.
    - Steps for auto login setup
      ```
          $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
          Generating public/private rsa key pair.
          Enter file in which to save the key (/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
          Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
          Enter same passphrase again:
          Your identification has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.
          Your public key has been saved in /home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

          Copy your keys to the target server:
          $ ssh-copy-id userid@server
          userid@server's password:

          Finally check logging inâ€¦
          $ ssh userid@server
      ```
  - Update multiple_instance_config.json file with server and DB configuration parameters

  - Run the main driver script (run_multiple_instance.sh)
    ```
      bash run_multiple_instance.sh 0
    ```
  - Note that it is preferred to run the mongodb instance on the same host as your node server for a better memory bandwidth utilization
