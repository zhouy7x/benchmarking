# Objective
The Node-DC is an open source collaboration project to develop workloads representing realistic use cases of Node.js in the data center. It started in 2016 with collaboration from the open source community, Node.js experts and companies playing important roles in Node.jsâ€™s evolution and production deployments in the data centers.

Workloads APIs, functionalities and metrics will be used to evaluate performance of the complete software stack for Node.js, Operating Systems, containers, virtualization, network stacks as well as various data center configuration choices. These are relevant for hardware and software developers, researchers and Node.js community. One priority for this project is to update the workloads in order to keep them up with the fast moving eco-system of Node.js.

# Contributing and Community

## Contribution to individual projects:
If you want to contribute code to a project, first you need to fork the project. Next step is to send a pull request (PR) for review to the repository. For small changes, you can implement at first step and for large changes, it is recommended to initially send the architecture and data flow, before investing significant time into the detailed implementation. The PR will be reviewed by the project team members. You need one "Looks Good To Me (LGTM)" and no objections from the project members. Once you have gained the required approval, the project maintainers will merge the PR.

# Node-DC-SSR (Node.js - Data Center - Server Side Rendering)

This is second in a series of upcoming workloads for modeling use cases of Node.js in Data Center (Node-DC). This workload is modeling server side rendering use cases.

Node-DC-SSR-electrode is built on top of the [@WalmartLabs Electrode Universal React/Node Application Framework](http://www.electrode.io/site/web.html).

# Node-DC-SSR
Node-DC-SSR consists of two components: a client and a Node.js server.

## Client (Node-DC-EIS-client)
Client controls various phases like ramp-up, measurement and ramp-down as well as issues requests, tracks response time and errors. At the end of run, it validates the runs and post-processes the transactions log producing final metrics and graphs.

## Node.js server (Node-DC-SSR-electrode)
Node.js server accepts all requests from client and responds back after generating HTML code.

# Node-DC-SSR Metrics  
Node-DC-SSR produces two primary metrics:
  - Throughput ( requests / second ): It is calculated by "requests in measurement phase / measurement time" 
  - p99 Response Time: It is 99 percentile of response time. 

Report also contains detailed response time data like minimum, maximum, average and p99 (99 percentile) of response time. 
Post-processing also produces response time graph as well as other histograms like memory utilization over the run length of the workload.

# Node-DC-SSR default and configurable options for research and testing  
Node-DC-SSR sets all parameters by default to model typical Node.js server deployment. Many important parameters have been defined in the configuration files to make it easy to be able to evaluate, test and validate wide variety of deployments.

Most parameters can be set in the client configuration file and these are passed to Node.js server. But some parameters must be set at the start of Node.js server. Such parameters must be defined in configuration files for respective components.

## Parameters in client configuration file ( Node-DC-EIS-client/config-ssr.json ) :
- "client_params"
  - "MT_interval": "100", // Runtime in Seconds
  - "request": "10000",  // Total number of requests to be issued
  - "concurrency": "200", // That many requests can be issued in parallel
  - "run_mode": "1", // 1 for time based run. 2 for request based run. Default is 1
  - "interval": "10", // Interval after which logging switches to next temp log file
  - "rampup_rampdown": "25", // After this many requests, execution will enter measurement phase
  - "tempfile": "RTdata", // Default name of the log file
  - "total_urls": "100", // Number of urls which will be used to issue requests
  - "server_ipaddress": "localhost", // Server IP address

  - "root_endpoint": "/",
  - "no_db": true, //  Skips all database loading and checking actions
  - "get_endpoints": ["count/10000/15"], // Directly specific which endpoints to use during operations (bypasses id, name, and zip ratios)
  - "http_headers": ["User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/59.0.3071.115 Safari/537.36"], // Extra HTTP headers to send to the server
  - "html": //
- "memory_params": // Parameters below helps in profiling memory usages by Node.js server
  - "memstat_interval": "1",
  - "memlogfile": "memlog_file"

## Parameters in server configuration file ( Node-DC-SSR-electrode/config/default.js ) :

  - "address": HOST_IP environmental variable or '0.0.0.0', // Listening address for server
  - "port": PORT environmental variable or 3000, // Listening port for server

### Starting server

Running application server (default port: 3000): 
  - Change directory to Node-DC-SSR-electrode,
  - Run "npm install" to install all dependencies (don't use sudo). 
  - Build server with "node node_modules/xclap/bin/clap.js build"
  - Start server with "NODE_ENV=production node node_modules/xclap/bin/clap.js server"

# Testing:
