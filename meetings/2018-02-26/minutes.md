### nodejs/benchmarking

* https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/issues/206
  * web  tooling benchmark is focussed on generic JavaScript, so does not cover aspects that
    are Node.js or environment specific.
  * Michael -> do we just need a new benchmark ?
  * Benedikt -> Yes but not JavaScript tooling, but more something like Node tooling
  * John -> some things hijack things in Node, so it will need to run a number of node processes
  * John will submit a pull request for benchmark
* Footprint increase - acmeair after load last 2 weeks [#203](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/issues/203)
  * Uttam agreed to investigate
