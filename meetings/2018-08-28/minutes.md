### nodejs/benchmarking

* Investigate the time taken, and number of benchmarks in core [#225](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/issues/225)
  * Skip since we don’t have Gareth
* Require cached pref much lower [#202](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/issues/202)
  * Skip since we don’t have Uttam
* Add Ghost.js workload to the benchmarking [#159](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/issues/159)
  * Skip since we don’t have Uttam
 
* Creation of new benchmarks
  * Rip and Oliver introduced themselves and they are interested in contributing to help fill in
    gaps in the matrix
  * Michael gave quick overview of some of the steps to add a benchmark and for charts to be
    generated
  * They will likely start with SPA and microservices and may look at agents and data collectors
     as well.
  * We should get them hooked up with @uttam so they can consider using DC-EIS as the 
     framework for the new benchmarks.
  * Next step is that Rip and Oliver will create an issue with the background and their initial
    Thoughts along with the ask for some people to talk to in terms of quantifying the SPA
   and microservice use cases.  Michael will then at mention people from the community
   to start to process of getting some of that input.
