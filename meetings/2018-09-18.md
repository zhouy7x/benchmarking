### nodejs/benchmarking

* Item for the agenda: Node-land threadpool [#239](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/issues/239)
  * Jamie asked a number of questions about existing usage
  * He is working to find use cases where thread pool usage is driven
    * dns
    * crypto
    * compression
  * Current plan to find use cases is to crawl npm and github as well as asking at
    Node+JS Interactive.
  * Uttam -> has list of 6 Intel has used to try out different workloads, 6 from 2015 micro paper.
  * Jamie, a few questions about how to add benchmarks.

* Investigate the time taken, and number of benchmarks in core [#225](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/issues/225)
  * Skip as we donâ€™t have Gareth

* Require cached pref much lower [#202](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/issues/202)
  * Michael/Uttam need to work to figure out why Uttam has not been able to access. 

* Add Ghost.js workload to the benchmarking [#159](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/issues/159)
  * Able to run ghost.js, still working on getting mysql working in docker. 
  * Seems different from other benchmarks in that it runs more Node.js 
    code as opposed to making database calls
